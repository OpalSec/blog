# Overview:

A very straightforward machine to work through, but a great initiation to compiling exploits with gcc and troubleshooting issues along the way.

# Enumeration

As always, start with an nmap scan to identify listening ports and services:
```
$> nmap -sS -sV -vv -O --script=http-methods -oA ./Kioptrix_1/allscan 192.168.58.128
```

- -sS: Stealth SYN Scan (Send the SYN - if you receive a SYN,ACK response, send a RST to close the connection. Helps with latency & avoids registering an ESTABLISHED connection in logs)
- -sV: Service Version Scan (Attempts to determine the version of the running Service)
- -vv: Very verbose output (Print results to std out as they come through)
- --script=http-methods: Check which HTTP methods are allowed (POST, GET, PUT, etc.)
- -oA: Output in all formats (gnmap, nmap, xml)

Providing us with this:

# Exploitation

The easiest thing to look for is a non-standard plugin/service that could potentially have slipped the patch process, or even just not have had a patch issued by the developer after an exploit was  found for it. In this case, the mod_ssl plugin looked non-standard and could potentially be exploitable, so a simple searchsploit query turned up a few options 

![mod_ssl](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix/mod_ssl.png)

Let's take a run at OpenFuckv2 - you can do what I did below to copy the exploit code for editing, or alternatively `searchsploit -m 764` would do the trick.

![localcopy](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix/localcopy.png)

Assuming the script worked perfectly, you should be able to compile it simply with `gcc -o OpenFuck OpenFuck.c -lcrypto`. Not in this case:

![Compile1](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix/Compile1.png)

- **Sidenote:** For those preparing for OSCP, expect to have to troubleshoot and modify exploit scripts - understanding what the script is meant to do and the error output is key to that.

In this case, it's saying openssl/ssl.h doesn't exist - simple enough to fix: a quick Google search shows the ```libssl-dev``` library is what we're after.  

![lib_ssl](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix/lib_ssl.png)

Re-attempting the compilation of the script, it's clear that there's a lot more missing from the script that needs to be done:

![Errors](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix/Errors.png)

I tried my hand at fixing them, but in the spirit of working smarter, not harder, I checked to see if anyone had run into these errors before.

After finding several blog posts that only partially fixed the issues, I came across one that had a full list of fixes: https://www.hypn.za.net/blog/2017/08/27/compiling-exploit-764-c-in-2017/. 

Adds include statements definitions for the openssl library; replaces inactive url to get ptrace which is needed for the exploit to work; fixes several function calls within the code, and more. 

While the instructions are really clear and I'd recommend going through it manually yourself to understand the changes you're making, if you're in a rush - here's [an edited and working version on the OpenFuck exploit](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix/OpenFuck.c)

Compile and run the exploit to see how to use it:
![ExploitOptions](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix/ExploitOptions.png)

The main thing we need to know was the Linux variant and the version of Apache running - checking the initial nmap scan results, we can see from the response from port 443: 
```Apache/1.3.20 (Unix)  (Red-Hat/Linux) mod_ssl/2.8.4 OpenSSL/0.9.6b```

Looking at the _Supported Offset_ list, there are only two real contenders:

```
0x60 - RedHat Linux 7.0 (apache-1.3.14-2)
0x61 - RedHat Linux 7.0-Update (apache-1.3.22-5.7.1)
0x62 - RedHat Linux 7.0-7.1 update (apache-1.3.22-5.7.1)
0x63 - RedHat Linux 7.0-Update (apache-1.3.27-1.7.1)
0x64 - RedHat Linux 7.1 (apache-1.3.19-5)1
0x65 - RedHat Linux 7.1 (apache-1.3.19-5)2
0x66 - RedHat Linux 7.1-7.0 update (apache-1.3.22-5.7.1)
0x67 - RedHat Linux 7.1-Update (1.3.22-5.7.1)
0x68 - RedHat Linux 7.1 (apache-1.3.22-src)
0x69 - RedHat Linux 7.1-Update (1.3.27-1.7.1)
>>> 0x6a - RedHat Linux 7.2 (apache-1.3.20-16)1 <<<
>>> 0x6b - RedHat Linux 7.2 (apache-1.3.20-16)2 <<<
0x6c - RedHat Linux 7.2-Update (apache-1.3.22-6)
0x6d - RedHat Linux 7.2 (apache-1.3.24)
0x6e - RedHat Linux 7.2 (apache-1.3.26)
0x6f - RedHat Linux 7.2 (apache-1.3.26-snc)
```

Attempting with the first configuration (0x6a) appears to fail:
![Attempt1](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix/Attempt1.png)

At first glance, setting 0x6b appears to work, but reading the output of the exploit it's apparent that it failed to download the ptrace program, the subsequent execution also failed.

![Attempt2](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix/Attempt2.png)

In my case, I was running the Kioptrix VM in Host-Only mode, so it made sense that it couldn't fetch ptrace. To get around this, I downloaded the file to my attacking station and used Python's Simple HTTP Server to serve it up:

![PythonServer](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix/PythonServer.png) 

I re-ran the exploit, waiting for it to hit the fail point for the PrivEsc portion, and ran the PrivEsc command manually

![rootShell](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix/rootShell.png) 

And we're done!
