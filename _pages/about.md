After discovering my passion for Information Security, I've worked steadily over the past few years to build my skills and understanding of Penetration Testing, Incident Response, and Network Monitoring.

I have extensive experience performing complex analytical and conducting red-team activities, which has been indespensible in seeing me excel in my current role as a Senior Cyber Security Analyst. 

I have completed four SANS courses and obtained their respective GIAC Certifications in order to develop a holistic understanding of both network attack and defence. I continue to develop these skills by working through hackthebox.eu and Vulnhub VMs, monitoring prominent Infosec publications and researchers, and continuing to upskill in relevant technologies such as Splunk, Illumio's Adaptive Security Platform, and the Autopsy Digital Forensics platform. 

I believe in undertaking challenging technical work to support meaningful outcomes, such as serving Australia's National Security with the DoD; and defending the communications of our Nation's politicians by working with the DPS.
